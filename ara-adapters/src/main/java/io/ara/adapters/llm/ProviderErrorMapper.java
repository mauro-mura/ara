/**
 * Classifies a provider failure using langchain4j's typed exception hierarchy, so that
 * {@link LlmException#isRetryable()} reflects what the provider actually said rather than what
 * a substring match guessed.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 * <p>Retryability is the one field of {@link LlmException} the runtime acts on:
 * {@code ReactExecutionSupport} retries a retryable failure and {@code FailoverLlmClient}
 * walks its fallback list for one. Each adapter used to decide it by matching status codes in
 * the exception <em>message</em>, and anything unmatched fell through to
 * {@code networkError(...)} — which is retryable. So a malformed request (HTTP 400: a media
 * part the endpoint does not accept, a bad schema, an unsupported parameter) was retried by
 * the strategy and then tried again against every fallback in the pool, for a request that
 * could not succeed on any of them.
 *
 * <p>langchain4j already answers the question properly. It maps HTTP failures onto
 * {@link RetriableException} / {@link NonRetriableException} subclasses — verified against
 * langchain4j 1.17: a 400 arrives as {@link InvalidRequestException} (non-retriable) wrapping
 * a {@code HttpException}. Reading that classification is both more accurate than a substring
 * match and immune to a provider rewording its error bodies.
 *
 * <h2>How adapters use it</h2>
 * <p>Adapters call this <em>after</em> their own provider-specific checks (which can be more
 * specific than the type — a context-length overflow arrives as a plain
 * {@link InvalidRequestException} but deserves its own {@code errorType}) and <em>before</em>
 * their {@code networkError} fallback:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * private LlmException mapException(Throwable ex) {
 *     // ... provider-specific checks that are more specific than the type ...
 *     LlmException typed = ProviderErrorMapper.fromTypedException(PROVIDER, ex);
 *     if (typed != null) return typed;
 *     return LlmException.networkError(PROVIDER, msg, ex);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>With this in place the retryable fallback is reached only when langchain4j itself could
 * not classify the failure — that is, for a genuine transport error, which is exactly the case
 * worth retrying.

    /**
     * Maps {@code ex}, or any exception in its cause chain, to an {@link LlmException} with the

     *
     * <p>The chain is walked because adapters and HTTP clients wrap: the typed exception is
     * often the cause rather than the throwable handed to the {@code catch}.
     *
     * <p>The two base classes are matched last, as a deliberate catch-all: a langchain4j

     * library upgrade that adds a subclass cannot silently make a non-retriable failure
