/**
 * A reference to one piece of media attached to a task — an image, a PDF, a text file —
 * carried through the whole domain without its bytes.
 *
 * <h2>Why a reference and not the bytes</h2>
 * <p>The bytes of a document break four things at once if they travel inside the domain
 * objects: they get base64-inflated into every persisted session turn, printed into the
 * request/response logs, counted as characters by the working-memory token estimate (a 2 MB
 * PDF reads as ~680k estimated tokens, which empties the whole window — system prompt
 * included — before the budget is met), and duplicated once per task that carries the same
 * file. Holding a reference makes all four disappear at once, with no per-agent flag to
 * turn any of them off: there is simply nothing large to store, log, count, or duplicate.
 * The bytes live in a {@link MediaStore} and are fetched exactly once, inside the adapter,
 * at the moment the provider request is built.
 *
 * <h2>Why one type and not four</h2>
 * <p>A single {@code MediaRef} list, rather than separate {@code images}/{@code audio}/
 * {@code videos}/{@code files} channels: the category is derivable from {@link #mimeType()}
 * via {@link MediaTypes#kindOf}, so typed channels would add no information while
 * multiplying every line of plumbing along the chain by four. Code that must branch by
 * category does so where it matters — in the adapter — via {@link #kind()}.
 *
 * <h2>Two ways to reach the bytes</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code uri == null} — the bytes live in the {@link MediaStore} under
 *       {@link #mediaId()}, which is their SHA-256 digest.</li>
 *   <li>{@code uri != null} — the bytes are reachable at that URI and ARA does not own
 *       them; {@link #mediaId()} is then an opaque identifier, and no {@code MediaStore}
 *       is consulted (nor may the store delete anything on their behalf).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param mediaId   SHA-256 digest of the bytes when they live in a {@link MediaStore};
 *                  an opaque identifier when {@code uri} is set
 * @param mimeType  the media type, validated against {@link MediaTypes#allowed()} and
 *                  stored in canonical (trimmed, lowercase) form
 * @param name      the original file name — shown to the model and used in logs, so it
 *                  should be the name a human would recognise, not a generated id
 * @param sizeBytes size of the payload in bytes; {@code 0} for a {@code uri}-backed
 *                  reference whose size the caller does not know
 * @param uri       where the bytes live when ARA does not hold them; {@code null} means
 *                  they are in the {@link MediaStore} under {@code mediaId}
