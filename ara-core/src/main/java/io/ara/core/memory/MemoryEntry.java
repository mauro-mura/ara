/**
 * A single entry in any of the ARA memory tiers.
 *
 * <p>{@link #media} holds references, not bytes, and that is what keeps the working-memory
 * window usable with a document attached. With the payload inline, a 2 MB PDF becomes ~2.7
 * million base64 characters, which the char-based token estimate reads as ~680k tokens: with
 * any realistic budget the eviction loop then empties the window down to one entry — and the
 * survivor is the document, so the agent loses its own system prompt and keeps the base64.
 * A reference is a few dozen characters, so no eviction policy has to be clever about it.
 *
 * <p>Media belongs to the entry rather than sitting beside it precisely so eviction cannot
 * separate the two: dropping the text while keeping the attachment (or the reverse) leaves a
 * message no provider accepts. Being one record makes that structurally impossible instead of
 * something the eviction code has to remember, the way it has to for tool-call groups.
 *
 * @param role      speaker role: "system", "user", "assistant", "tool", "episode"
 * @param content   the text content of the entry
 * @param timestamp when this entry was recorded
 * @param metadata  optional structured metadata ({@link ToolCallMetadata},
 *                  {@link EpisodeLabel}); {@code null} when the entry carries none
 * @param media     references to images and documents attached to this entry, in presentation
 *                  order; never {@code null}, empty for the text-only entries that are the
 *                  overwhelming majority
