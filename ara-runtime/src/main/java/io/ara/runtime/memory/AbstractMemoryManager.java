/**
 * Base class that provides the canonical in-process working-memory implementation.
 *
 * <p>Subclasses inherit {@link #appendToWorkingMemory}, {@link #workingMemory}, and
 * {@link #clearWorkingMemory} and only need to implement the semantic/episodic tiers.
 * {@link SlidingWindowMemoryManager} overrides {@code appendToWorkingMemory} to apply
 * token-budget eviction while still sharing the same {@code working} list.
 *
 * <p><b>Thread safety:</b> confined, not internally synchronised. One memory manager belongs to
 * one {@link io.ara.core.agent.SessionId}, and a session runs one task at a time, so {@code
 * working} is <em>mutated</em> only by the single thread driving that session's strategy. That is
 * the invariant every mutation here relies on; it is not enforced by the type.
 *
 * <p>The one place other threads touch {@code working} is {@link #workingMemory()}: during a
 * parallel tool dispatch ({@code ReactExecutionSupport.dispatchBounded}) the worker virtual threads
 * can call it — but only through {@code InterceptingToolRegistry}, and so only when an interceptor
 * is registered. Those are concurrent <em>reads</em>, and each returns a {@link List#copyOf}
 * snapshot rather than a live view, so they are safe against each other. They stay safe against the
 * driver thread because the driver writes {@code working} only after {@code dispatchBounded}'s latch
 * has joined every worker — the read phase and the write phase do not overlap.
 *
 * <p><b>The invariant a tool or interceptor must not break:</b> do not write to working memory
 * (append/clear) from inside a tool's or interceptor's own execution during a parallel dispatch.
 * A write concurrent with another worker's {@link #workingMemory()} read would race on the plain
 * {@link ArrayList} — a {@link java.util.ConcurrentModificationException} or a torn read.
 * {@code CopyOnWriteArrayList} was rejected as the guard: working memory is rewritten every ReAct
 * iteration, so its O(n)-per-append copy would tax the hot path to defend a case the confinement
 * invariant already rules out (A1 — simplicity is not traded for a cost nobody measured as needed).
