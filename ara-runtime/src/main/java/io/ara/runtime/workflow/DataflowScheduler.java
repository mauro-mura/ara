/**
 * The scheduler ADR-052 D1 decides on: dataflow with a per-node journal, not superstep
 * (BSP, the model LangGraph and Microsoft's frameworks converge on).
 *
 * <p>A superstep scheduler synchronizes on a global step boundary — every node ready at
 * step N runs, then every node ready at step N+1 runs, and so on. That boundary is where
 * the category's recurring defect lives: on a fan-in whose branches have uneven depth,
 * the short branch's token lands at step N and the long branch's at step N+1, so the join
 * fires once per branch instead of once total, the second time with a partial input. This
 * was reproduced side by side against the scheduler here, on the same graph, before the
 * activation rule below replaced the superstep model.
 *
 * <p>D1's activation rule sidesteps the whole category by asking a different question:
 * not "when did a token arrive" but "which edges carry one". Every node ready by that
 * rule is submitted the instant it's ready, with no step boundary anywhere.
 *
 * <p><b>Concurrency invariant.</b> Every mutation of scheduler state — token deques, the
 * dead-edge set, occurrence counters, the journal — happens on the thread that called
 * {@link #run}, never inside a worker. Workers only evaluate {@link WorkflowNode#body()}
 * and {@link WorkflowNode#selector()}, pure functions of their input. That's what lets
 * this stay lock-free: a sequential control flow around the state eliminates the whole
 * class of races a naive concurrent map would need locking to avoid, and no workflow this
 * targets (tens of nodes, sub-minute bodies) is large enough for that to cost anything
 * real (coding guideline A1).
 *
 * <p>Not a bounded resource pool, and not meant to be one: this class is single-run,
 * single-use — construct one per {@link #run} call.
