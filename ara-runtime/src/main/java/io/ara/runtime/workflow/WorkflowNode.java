/**
 * One unit of work in a {@link WorkflowGraph}: how to compute its output from its
 * composed input, which of its outgoing edges to activate, and what resuming should do
 * if this node was in flight when a prior run stopped.
 *
 * <p>D1 keeps this deliberately opaque — {@code body} is a plain function, not an
 * {@code io.ara.core.agent.AraAgent}. Wiring an agent-shaped node (routing through
 * {@code AraAgent.execute}, {@code RunState} writes, tool calls) is ADR-052 D2's job:
 * D1 only has to prove the scheduler's activation rule holds, and an opaque function is
 * the smallest thing that can exercise it without dragging in a facade this increment
 * deliberately does not build yet. That increment is now layered on top: a node declared
 * through {@link #agent(String, AgentBinding)} carries an {@link AgentBinding}, and
 * {@link #run(String)} executes the agent and captures its {@link AgentResponse} — so
 * token usage and cost reach the journal instead of vanishing into a string.
 *
 * @param id                 the node's identifier, unique within its {@link WorkflowGraph}
 * @param body               input (composed from incoming edges) to output; throwing
 *                           {@link WorkflowNodeSuspendedException} records a {@link
 *                           NodeOutcome.Suspended} instead of a {@link NodeOutcome.Failed}
 * @param selector           output to the subset of outgoing edges to activate;
 *                           {@code null} means "activate every outgoing edge" — the
 *                           common case for a non-routing node
 * @param onUncertainResume  what {@link DataflowScheduler} should do with this node on
 *                           resume if it was started but never finished in the prior run
 * @param cost               output to the {@link Spend} this occurrence drew (money,
 *                           tokens, LLM calls), charged to the run's {@code RunBudget}
 *                           (ADR-054 D6); {@code null} means "declares no cost" — the
 *                           node still counts as one activation but adds nothing on the
 *                           token / money axes. For an agent-shaped node this is ignored
 *                           in favour of the {@link AgentResponse}'s own totals: the
 *                           response is the source of truth once there is one, and a
 *                           caller-declared {@code cost} can only under- or over-state it.
 * @param write              output to a {@link Write}, merged into the run's shared
 *                           state under a declared reducer (ADR-052 D3); {@code null}
 *                           means "writes nothing" — most nodes.
 * @param mapOver            declares this node as a dynamic fan-out source (ADR-052 D4);
 *                           {@code null} means "an ordinary node" — almost all of them.
 * @param composer           how this node combines the tokens of its several forward
 *                           incoming edges into its single input, in edge-declaration
 *                           order (never completion order — that is what keeps a join
 *                           deterministic under concurrency). {@code null} means "not
 *                           declared", and a node with more than one forward predecessor
 *                           that declares none is refused at build time
 *                           ({@code Workflow.Builder}'s control #10) rather than silently
 *                           joined by the placeholder concatenation. Runs on the
 *                           scheduler's control thread, not the pool, so it must be
 *                           cheap: a composer is for <em>shaping</em> the several inputs
 *                           into one, never for the work of deciding between them — that
 *                           belongs in {@link #body()}, which does run on the pool.
 * @param agent              the agent this node runs, when it is agent-shaped (ADR-052
 *                           D2); {@code null} for an ordinary opaque node. When set,
 *                           {@link #run(String)} executes it and the resulting
 *                           {@link AgentResponse} — not {@link #body()} — is the node's
 *                           outcome, so tokens/cost are captured rather than lost.
